# About The Author {epub:type=afterword}

Mrs. Mary Harrison was born in Georgia, where she still resides today.
She was one of a large, poverty-stricken family,
and her father's blindness only added to the family's suffering.

She left home and married at an early age,
to raise a large family of nine children.
Her husband's alcoholism forced her to work hard her entire life
in order to keep her family together.
When still a young woman,
she remarried a fine man who treated her with respect and kindness.

Although she has spent her days living alone since becoming a widow,
she is a proud grandmother of sixteen and a great-grandmother of four.
