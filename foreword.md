# Foreword {epub:type=foreword}

Here is a candid autobiography of a Georgian girl, Connie,
who with outspoken honesty tells us of her life's woes and rewards.
And the sorrows and suffering seem to so outweigh the happiness,
the reader will only wonder why life gives so little joy to some,
and seemingly so much to the more fortunate among us.
All names within are purely fictitious, to protect the innocent.

Born into a large, poor family,
oftentimes her dinner consisted of only some bread
and the green top of a rotten onion planted under the ground.
Because of her father's blindness, she had to help her parents earn money
by selling such items as soap and needles.
Connie also quit high school to work in a factory to help her family out,
and soon after, just barely into her teens, she married a co-worker's brother.
Hoping this might ease her own family's misery as well as her own,
it in fact only led to further frustration and unhappiness.

Before long her husband, Lonnie, turned into an unfaithful alcoholic,
and Connie became the primary wage earner and provider.
Soon afterwards a child was on the way, and then another,
and another...nine in all, as well as several miscarriages,
and this only added to her burdens and constant struggle.

Yet in spite of, and possibly because of her many children,
she succeeded in strengthening herself enough to take on the roles of mother,
wife, and supporter.
The family unit was the source of her inspiration and ambition.
Her children also provided her with a sense of pride and satisfaction.
For them alone she fought on desperately,
sacrificing much independence and taking on demeaning occupations.

After the loss of her daughter through cancer, life began to improve for her,
and her outlook brightened in her frugal existence.
Her family and friends served as her everlasting contentment throughout all.
The reader will come to realize how love and understanding
from one's fellow beings bring joy to life.

Share in *The Life of Connie*, by Mary Harrison, and you will be enlightened
by her resilience and faith in overcoming the harshest of adversity.
It is a book you will long remember.
