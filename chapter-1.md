# CHAPTER 1

My name is Mrs. Connie Steele and I am forty-four years old.
I am the mother of nine living children and eight dead children
(who died at birth), and ten grandchildren.
I was born in a little two-room house in Polks Alley,
called part of the slums of Augusta, Georgia.

A friend of my mother's came to live with her before I was born.
Her name was Nell Davis.
She was expecting a baby also.
When my mother was not at home, Nell would nurse me from one breast
and her baby from the other.
Nell's baby lived about four months.
After her baby died, mother said she took care of me most of the time
and loved me as if I was her own child.
She would take me everywhere she went.

My mother married twice and had two children by her first marriage,
a boy and a girl.
Her first husband died and then she married her brother, who was my father.
She then had four children by my father, two boys and two girls.
I was the second oldest child.
After my baby sister was born,
my father lost his eyesight and we had a hard time.
He was very nervous and if a storm came up,
he would call all the children together
and we would go into the hall with him until the storm was over.

Nell left us when I was seven years old
to go live with her mother in Charleston, South Carolina.
My half sister was living with my grandmother, so I had all the work to do.

My mother was keeping house and tending to children
for a family who lived near us.
She had been working there for several months when she had a stroke.
This was brought on by high blood pressure.
I was about eight years old at that time
and had to do all the cooking for the family.
My father would sit at the end of the wood stove and keep the fire going for me.
I would drag a chair up to the stove so I would be high enough
to put the meat and bread in iron skillets on top of the stove.
My grandmother moved in with us to help out, and she sewed for people.

When my mother got better and was able to get around,
she and my father began selling needles and soap to make ends meet.
We had gotten so far behind in the rent
that we had to move into a four-room house.
It was located on St. Luke Street by the canal,
and was cold and damp and had a chimney in the center.

I remember one day when I came home from school
my half sister was hiding up in the fireplace.
I called her and she came out with soot all over her.
I asked what was wrong,
and she told me she was hiding from a man who came over
when the children were in school, after mother and daddy left.
He would try and kiss her and make love.
One day I got sick at school and my teacher sent me home early.
When I got there, I found this man in the house
chasing Joan from one room to another saying he had something to show her.
He had a writing tablet in his hand.
When he saw me, he ran dropping the tablet.
I picked up the tablet to see what he had been doing.
He had drawn a picture of a man sitting in a chair
with a naked woman straddling his lap.
I took the picture and showed it to Joan
and she begged me not to show it to my mother or tell anyone about it.
But I knew it was wrong, so I told my mother about it.
A few days later my aunt and uncle
moved around the corner near us with their children.

I heard my mother telling my aunt about this man bothering Joan.
My mother told my aunt that he was an artist
and he would draw these vulgar pictures
and try to show them to all the young girls in the neighborhood.
The police had caught him and put him in jail.
That was the last I heard of him.
A few months later, Joan got a job in a cotton mill
and that gave us a little more money to buy food.

I used to go to my aunt's house a lot and play with my cousin.
There was just a month's difference in our ages.
We played together for two years and got along fine, until one day,
my aunt's sister Vera came to live with her.
She was about nineteen years old and drank quite a bit.
My mother told me she did not want me to visit my aunt anymore because of her.
I missed my cousin so much and was so lonely, that when my mother went out,
I slipped over to play with my cousin.
Vera had turned my cousin against me and she held me while my cousin whipped me.
I went home and told mother what had happened and she told me
that we were going to move in a few days anyway,
because with Joan working in the cotton mill, we were able to get a mill house.
She said that I would probably meet new friends there.

There were eight in the family to feed and since Joan was the only one working,
it gave us very little money for groceries.
I used to go behind the stores and pick through the garbage cans
to get rotten onions to set out so I could have something to eat with my bread.
They really tasted good when you're hungry and that was quite often.
Sometimes we had dry butter beans, peas or potatoes
but back in those days times were so hard,
that my mother and father sold very little.

One day when my parents were away from home,
Joan came home from work as usual, around lunch time.
She was working part time.
My aunt's sister came over to my house and I overheard them talking.
Vera told Joan that she did not have to work in an old cotton mill
and do without pretty clothes and things that she wanted.
She told Joan that she was very pretty and needed pretty things.
She knew where she could get them.
But Joan told her that she did not want to live the kind of life
she was suggesting.
But my aunt's sister would not give up.
She kept coming to the house and tempting Joan
about the nice things she could have.
She was about two years older than Joan.
This went on for about two months.
Then one evening my half-sister did not come home from work.
When mother asked me if she came home from work I told her no,
that she had not, but that I thought she might be visiting some of her friends.

About two o'clock the next morning I woke and heard my mother crying.
She was sitting at the front window crying and looking down the street.
I knew something was wrong.
I asked, "Why are you crying?"

She said, "Joan did not come home and I am worried."

The next day Joan came home and I heard my mother talking to her,
begging her not to have anything to do with Vera,
because she only meant trouble.
Joan told mother she was tired of working and never having anything
and she wanted nice things like Vera had.
Mother said,
"If you are going to live that kind of life, you can not stay here."
So Joan decided to leave.

I was around ten years old when my half sister left home.
Her leaving left all the housework on me
and tending to my youngest brother and sister.
My brother, two years older than I,
got a job in a drug store and that helped some.
Mother went to the cotton mill to see if she could find work.
She knew someone had to work in the mill,
if we continued to live in the mill house.
They gave her Joan's job.

My half brother used to stay at the YMCA all the time playing basketball.
He wanted work but refused to work in a cotton mill.
Then one day he came home and told mother he had a job
running a movie picture at the YMCA.
That was before taking pictures started.
After he went to work, I started to have some friends,
because they wanted to see the shows free.
Things began to look a lot better and brighter for me.
I thought then, that life was worth living.
I began to enjoy my childhood.
There were three working in the family now
and we lived as good as anyone in the neighborhood.

My childhood was happy for a year,
then I became ill with double pneumonia and typhoid fever.
My mother had managed to save a little money, but my illness took it all.
After I recovered, my father started drinking.
At first, he only drank about once a week.
My father stopped going to church,
but my mother was a good Christian woman and went to church, rain, sleet or snow
and she took her children with her.
She tried very hard to make decent men and women out of us,
but the way we turned out was no fault of hers, because she really tried.

After my father started drinking again Joan came home sick.
While she was away she had gotten married,
but said she could live with him because he beat her so often.
She had lost so much weight and looked so pale,
mother took her to the doctor to see what was wrong.
The doctor told mother that Joan had TB and was beyond help.
There was no cure for her.
Mother put Joan in a room by herself,
to keep from exposing the other children to the disease.
That is when my so-called friends stopped coming around.
Their parents would not let them come to our house,
because they were afraid they would catch TB.
Joan only lived six months.

My half brother Ben was a professional basketball player
and an excellent swimmer.
He won the world's championship for being the best swimmer.
Then he became involved with two young girls and got both of them pregnant.
He married the oldest one Helen, but it was what they called a shotgun wedding.
Helen's mother said she would kill him if he did not marry her daughter.
But he really loved the other girl and wanted to marry her.

When I was twelve years old
I was still taking care of my youngest brother and sister.
One day we were out in the field across from the house
playing with our little dog.
I looked up and saw some people on our porch.
One of the women was shaking her finger at my mother.
I knew something was wrong, so my sister, brother, and I ran home.
As I got close to the house I recognized the people.
They were neighbors who lived about three doors from us.
When I got up on the porch, the woman turned and said,
"I am going to have you put in reform school."
She accused me of giving her thirteen-year-old boy a bad disease.
I do not think I ever saw my mother so hurt as she was that day.
I told mother I was not guilty.
She said,
"I believe you, but I will take you to a doctor to satisfy the Hill's."
So she took me to the doctor and he gave her statements to show the Hill's
that there was nothing wrong with me and also that I was a virgin.

Later on, Mrs. Hill came to my mother and told her that she had been wrong,
and was very sorry she had accused me of such a thing.
She found out that her oldest son had the disease
and the doctor told her he could have contacted it from him.
The doctor had been treating him for a long time,
but she had not known about it.
Of course it was too late to be sorry,
for she had wrecked my life and also my father's.
I never forgave her.

My father began to drink heavily after that.
I used to wish I were dead.
I would walk down the street and people would point at me
and soon it got where I hated the whole human race.
My father began to get very mean when he was drunk.
Almost every time he got drunk, he would jump on mother and want to beat us.
Several times I heard him threaten to set the bed on fire when she was asleep.
He was a good father when he was sober, but very cruel when he was drunk.

I remember one time when he had mother and I locked in a room
and mother told me to go out the window and get the police.
During these days, the police rode horses
and sometimes you would have to go three or four blocks to find one.
When I found a policeman and got back to the house,
my father had beaten mother something awful.
He stayed in jail about a week before mother got him out.
He swore he would never drink anymore whiskey and kept that promise for a year.
But then he started drinking again and this time it was worse than ever.
When he was sober, he would say grace at the table for about twenty minutes,
but when he was drunk, he had a short grace that would go like this:
"Bless the meat, damn the skin, back you ears and poke it in."
I can remember every word to this very day.

My mother asked her foreman if she could bring me in the mill
and teach me how to spool.
That was her kind of work.
I was not old enough to work,
but he knew the condition of the family and put my age up two years.
This made me fourteen, so I was able to work.
I was large for my age.
We would leave home at five o'clock in the morning
and work until six in the evening.
During those days we had to work long hours.
When I got home in the evening,
I would have to get dressed and go to night school.
I was the youngest in my class.
Most everyone in my class were adults.

I had been going to night school for about two weeks
when this girl who lived down the street
came by the house to walk to school with me.
She had been going to school for a long time.
She was about seventeen years old and a little crazy.
She used to ask me to wait at the corner
while she went back into the school yard to play around with the boys.
She would try to get me to go with her,
but I was afraid of what they would do to me.
Mother always warned me against boys.
She said they could ruin me if they put their hands on me.
That is why I never fooled around with them.

I was in night school for about two months
and waiting for her one night near the stone cottage where we attended school.
It was very dark and I saw her
and two boys about nineteen years old coming toward me.
I did not know what they had in mind but I soon found out.
They came up close to me and she said, "grab her!"
They put their hands over my mouth and half toted
and dragged me down down the dirt street that led into the school yard.
One of the boys whistled
and two more boys about the same age came from the stone building.
They pinned me to the ground and tore my pants off.
I was kicking and squirming.
They could not do what they wanted with me, but the largest boy in the crowd
said he would fix me good if they would hold me tight.
They said alright they would.
Herman, that was the only name I could remember,
got down on his knees between my legs and had his thing in his hand.
He tried and tried to put it in but could not get anywhere.
He said, "I cannot get my thing in, but I will get my finger in."
He succeeded with his finger and I could feel something running down my legs.
I later found out it was blood.
I managed to get loose and scream.
I heard a police whistle so I knew the police were close by.
The boys ran.
Audry said, "Run and get out of here or they will take us to jail."
I was so afraid, but went along with her.

Audry told me if I said anything about it,
they would take me away from my mother and send me to a girls training school.
I decided that I would not go back to night school.
I would just go to work and from there to home,
that way I would not get into any trouble.

I had been working in the spool room for a little over two years
when the foreman came over to mother
and told her he was going to put me on the coarse yarn,
because I was too fast for the fine yarn.
Two people had to run one frame, tying threads with a knotter.
My mother worked on the same frame in front of me.
I started to work with a young girl about my age.
She walked down to the end of the frame and got a box of snuff
and asked me if I would like some.
I told her no, that I had tried some one time, and it made me sick.
She then told me her name was Pat Morris and asked me mine.
I told her my name was Connie and she invited me to come see her.
It must have been about a week later that my father sent me after my mother,
who was visiting my aunt.
Pat was there, for she lived only a few doors from my aunt.
Pat asked my mother if I could go with her and mother said yes.
When we got there, she introduced me to her oldest brother, Lonnie.
He asked if he could come to see me at my house.
I told him no, that I did not like boys.

He had heard what had happened with the Hill's
and asked if that was the reason I would not talk to him.
I did not say anything.
I just turned and ran out the door.
I did not want anything to do with boys.
I was afraid of them.
The next night he came to my house.
He asked my father if he could court me.
My father said yes, if I wanted him to, but I told him no.
He would not give up.
Still I would not see him when he came to the house.

Lonnie began showing up at the mill pretending to visit his sister.
He would walk around the frame
and started putting yarn on the spinners trying to help me.
He told me to stop dodging him
for he did not believe the stories he had heard about me.
He treated me so nice that I finally agreed to let him come and see me.
I had been dating for about two weeks when one day I started to the store
and met Joe, a boy who I had liked at school.
Joe asked if he could see me, so I told him all right.
He came to the house that night and we walked across the street to the park
and sat on the bench.
We were sitting there talking when Lonnie came up--he was really mad.
He told me to tell Joe to go or he would go and never come back.
I told Joe that he would have to go.
The next night when I came home from work,
I was standing in front of the mirror by the window,
trying to darken my eyebrows when Joe jumped in the window
and asked me if I would run away and marry him.
He said he had his brother's car
and we could go to South Carolina and get married.
He said his brother would go with us.
He said that Lonnie was telling everybody that he was going to marry me.
Joe said, "Connie, you surely do not want to marry that boy for he is no good,
he drinks all the time and he will not work."
Joe said he loved me and wanted to marry me.
He told me he would make me a good husband.
But I was afraid to go, because I didn't know what would happen to me.
I told him I would think it over and let him know.

The next day, Lonnie's sister Pat told me she liked me a lot
and would very much like me to be her sister-in-law.
I told Pat I was too young to get married and my mother needed my help.
You could not make over a dollar and a half a day on the fast yarn
and mother could only make a dollar a day.
There were six of us in the family.
I gave mother all I made except a dime.
I would take the dime
and buy myself a dill pickle and a box of saltine crackers.
That was my luxury at the end of the week.

Lonnie and Pat kept begging me to marry him but I always said no.
One night I came home from work and Aunt Minnie was there.
She was not really my aunt,
but she had married my grandmother's brother and we called her aunt.
At supper that night, there were only three eggs.
My father took two of them, mashed them up with two biscuits
and divided them between my youngest sister and brother.
He told my older brother to share half of his egg with me, but he refused.
I left the table and went into the other room crying.
I was tired, I had worked all day from six to six.
Aunt Minnie came in the room and said, "Hush child, don't cry."
"Why don't you find yourself somebody and get married?"
I told her I thought I would do just that.
I then told her about Lonnie and Joe.
She told me to marry the one I thought would make me the best husband
and that she would help me any way she could.

The next morning I told Pat that I would marry Lonnie
if he still wanted to get married.
She said she would tell him.
That night Lonnie came to the house and told me to be ready in an hour,
that he and Pat would pick me up.
He said Pat would pack some clothes, she was going with us.
I told Aunt Minnie about them waiting for me at the corner.
She told me she would help me out the window so that my mother could not see me.
She said she would tell mother and father that I had gone to get married.
