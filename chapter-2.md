# Chapter 2

Pat's boyfriend took us to Leesville, South Carolina,
to an aunt and uncle of theirs.
It was too late to get married when we got there,
so Pat told them we were married.
She said she had to say that so they would let us stay there.
Pat told me she would make sure nothing would happen before we got married.
Her aunt said she only had one extra bed.
Pat went outside to get the suitcase, but her boyfriend had already gone
taking their suitcase and what money they had.
Pat slept in the middle of the bed that night
with me on one side and Lonnie on the other.
The next morning Lonnie got his uncle to take us to another aunt's house
at Batesburg, South Carolina.
Lonnie borrowed some money from his cousin
and told me he was going to walk to Gilbert, South Carolina
to get the license so we could get married.
Gilbert was a long way from Batesburg.
He walked there and back but was not able to get the license.
They told him I had to be with him.
So we asked his cousin to borrow his father's car and drive us back to Gilbert.
He said he would.

We stayed with his aunt and uncle for a week and then came back to Augusta.
We had to live with his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Morris,
because neither Lonnie nor I had a job.
His sister Pat was the only one in the family working.
He had two other sisters, Ellen the oldest, and Peggy, the baby.
His father was in bad health and was not able to work much
but would sell needles and liniment that he made himself
to help with the rent and food.

We had been living with his parents about two months
when the mill shut down and Pat was out of work.
Pat, Ellen and I would go from door to door selling sewing needles.
We tried to make enough money to buy food, but it was never enough to go around.
We were always hungry and no one could get along.
It got so bad Lonnie and I had to leave and go to my mother's to stay.
Lonnie got a job on a vegetable truck with a Mr. Pardue.
He made a dollar a day.
We stayed with my parents about two months.
We slept on an old iron bed in the kitchen.

One day I was lying across the bed just looking out the window.
There was a boy across the street standing at his window
with the front of his pants open, waving at me.
Lonnie came in the kitchen door and as I got up from the bed,
he said I waved at the boy, but I had not.
He pulled out his knife and cut me across my right hand.
That trouble meant we had to leave, so we went back to his parents' house.
We had been there only two weeks when his father got drunk and landed in jail.
They were having an awful hard time.
There were no jobs anywhere.
His two older sisters had to start getting money the best way they could
to feed their mother and baby sister and themselves.

Pat began to drink and she and Ellen would have men bring whiskey to the house.
Lonnie and his brother Allen started drinking with them.
This went on for three or four months.
We were then living on St. Luke Street but decided to move to Broad Street.
We had just moved in and were very tired and decided to go to bed early.
The next morning Ellen and I were sitting on the front porch
when she turned to me and said, "your mother and father cannot come here".
That made me mad.
I told her they could come if they wanted to as long as I lived there.
She said, "In that case, you are leaving now, and if you do not leave,
I will throw your clothes in the street."
I told her if she touched my clothes I would slap her face.
She then got up from her chair
and went into the house and picked up all my clothes.
That started a fight that lasted off and on all day.
Lonnie and Allen would separate us for a few minutes
and then she would start to get my clothes and the fight would start all over.
Ellen was determined to throw my clothes in the street
and I was just as determined not to let her.
Around seven o'clock that evening I agreed to leave,
but I did carry my own clothes and that was when the fighting stopped.

We moved back to my mother's house.
Right after that, Lonnie's parents moved to Shultz Hill, South Carolina.
This was around Christmas time.
Mother had gotten some kind of insurance
and my father had bought an old Chevrolet car.
Lonnie would drive the car for my father.
We went to visit Lonnie's parents and baby sister on Christmas Eve.
His mother had been crying.
I asked her what was wrong.
She said, "Peggy, the baby was expecting Santa Claus,"
but that she did not have money to buy her anything.
I told her that Lonnie had a little money
and we would go to town and buy her something.
We bought her a little doll and tea set.

I had gotten my job back in the mill when Lonnie's mother wrote him
asking us to find them a house to rent and help them get moved.
We found a house in Green's Alley,
which had three large rooms and a small room in the back.
Lonnie borrowed Mr. Pardue's truck to move their furniture.
We spent all our money for rent and food, which meant we had to stay there too.

We had been living with them about two weeks
when Lonnie's two older sisters came to live there also.
They had been living in hotels.
One Saturday night Ellen brought home her friend Nell.
The next morning Nell started making eyes at Lonnie.
I did not like this, but didn't say anything.
Finally I asked Lonnie to come in the back room for a minute.
Nell followed us pretending to come for a deck of cards
Lonnie had in his pocket.
She said they were going to play some five hundred rummy
and asked if we wanted to play.
Lonnie said he did, but I didn't want to.
But I did watch them play.
Nell began to flirt with Lonnie.
I was getting madder and madder.
I jumped off the old trunk that I had been sitting on
and told Nell to stop flirting with my husband.
She just laughed at me.
She knew she could whip me because I was so small.
I told Lonnie to stop playing cards and go back to our room.
He got up from the bed and told them he had to have a little talk with me,
but would be back.
Lonnie told me Nell was only teasing.
I told him I didn't like it and please not to go back out there.
I asked him for his pocket knife, and he wanted to know why.
I said I wanted to cut my finger nails and so he gave it to me.
I opened it and put it in my pocket.
I was still mad, I knew I could not whip her in a fair fight.
I followed Lonnie back into the room and took my seat on the trunk again.
Nell continued to flirt with Lonnie,
knowing all along I was getting madder and madder.
She got up from the bed and leaned over
and got Lonnie around the neck and began to hug and kiss him.
She said, "I've got to have some of you."
I was seeing red.
I jumped up from the trunk, grabbed her arm,
trying to pull her loose and told her to leave my husband alone.
She said, "Everybody leave the room, I am going to get me some right now."
I must have went crazy because the next thing I knew
I had stuck the knife in one side of her throat
and brought it back to the other.
I had murder in my heart.
That is the only time I ever wanted to kill anyone.
I then drew the knife back to cut her again, when the two men grabbed me.
I managed to get loose and ran to my mother's house on Pearl Avenue,
about six blocks from Green's Alley.
I told my father what had happened and he told me not to worry,
that he would get me out of it.
He said,
"You had a reason for doing what you did, and you also had two witnesses."

The police came and took me to jail.
They had taken Nell to the hospital.
My father got a bondsman
but they would not let me out until they knew whether Nell would survive or not.

After I got out of jail, I decided I would not live with Lonnie anymore.
A day or two later, I began having a sick stomach, and could not eat.
I was pregnant, but did not know it.
My mother insisted that I go to see Dr. Hand, our family doctor.
He told me that I was pregnant and I was very disappointed,
for I did not want any children.
I swore I would destroy it if I could.

There was a young girl who lived next door to mother who had small children.
I told her I was pregnant and asked if she knew how I could get rid of it.
She told me to get some quinine and that if I took a dozen capsules,
I would be fixed up.
I took the quinine but it did not work; it only made me sick.
My grandmother saw how sick I was
and suspected that I had taken some medicine to get rid of the baby.
She had a talk with me and said that it was murder,
and I should be ashamed of myself.
I still did not lose the baby.

I was about four and half months pregnant and still working at the mill
when Ellen came to my mother's house to ask for my help
in moving her parents back to Augusta.
She told me she was working at a hotel
and she would come back on Friday after I got paid.
I got my check and we went to look for a house.

Lonnie and his brother Allen,
living with their parents in Batesburg, South Carolina,
were both working in the cotton mill.
They bought a T Model Ford.
We did not find a house so we went back to my mother's house.
Lonnie and Allen were there.
Lonnie begged me to come back to him,
that he had gotten his job back and besides that,
his mother had changed her mind about moving back to Augusta.
She also had a room that we could have.
I told him I was tired of living in the house with our parents.
I wanted to cook and keep house for just the two of us.
He told me to quit work.
He wanted to get some furniture
so we could keep house in the one room at his mother's house.
I decided to give it another try.

Ellen said she was going to stay at the hotel,
that she didn't want to go back to Batesburg.
Lonnie and I went back there to live once more.
Everything went fine for about two months.
Lonnie, Allen and their father got to drinking, arguing and fighting.
Lonnie's mother and I tried to separate them.
Allen picked up an axe and hit Lonnie
and his mother somehow got between them and was hit in the back.
Peggy, the youngest sister, and I somehow managed
to get Mrs. Morris inside the house.
Allen had knocked the breath out of her.
I locked the door and got some camphor,
bathed her face and wrists to revive her.
I went to the window to see if the fighting had stopped.
The men were drinking moonshine whiskey from a half gallon fruit jar.
It looked safe to go outside, so I went to get Lonnie.
We had just gotten inside when Allen came to get Lonnie
to go with him down to the Burgess' house
to get another half gallon of moonshine.
Their daddy had dropped the jar and broke it,
and they wanted some more to drink.
About that time Red, a friend of theirs,
drove up and they all went off together.
The next time I saw Lonnie he was full of sand
and they did not have their daddy with them.
They had lost him on some country road.
I asked Lonnie why he was covered with sand,
and he told me that Allen and Red tried to bury him alive.
Allen and Red went back to try to find his daddy,
and Lonnie decided to stay home.
He said he did not want to be buried alive any more
since the next time he might not be so lucky.

By Monday, everybody was sober enough to go back to work
and things were back to normal.
I was about eight months pregnant
and Lonnie was working in the cord room at the cotton mill.
Pat suggested one night that we go up to the mill and bring Lonnie his supper.
We had to go up some narrow winding steps to get to the cord room.
When we started back down the stairs,
I tripped and fell all the way to the bottom.
Pat ran down the steps to pick me up.
She asked me if I was hurt anywhere.
I told her that I thought I was just shook up a little
and my knees were skinned.
But the next morning one side of my face was drawn so badly
that my jaw teeth showed.
I was swollen and looked so terrible that I stayed in my room most of the time.
When Lonnie wasn't at work, he was off somewhere else.
He never did stay at home, except at night to sleep.

Lonnie's mother had a clay pipe and I enjoyed watching her smoke.
One day I asked her if I could smoke her pipe.
She told me to ask Lonnie to go buy me one.
I asked Lonnie to get me one
and he told me that I looked funny enough without smoking a pipe.
I slipped around and smoked Mrs. Morris' pipe
but she caught me and bawled me out.
She made Lonnie go buy me one.

Mrs. Morris told Lonnie to take me to the doctor when I was in my ninth month.
The doctor told me that I had had a slight stroke,
but would probably straighten out after the baby was born.
Lonnie told me he could not stand looking at me for another month,
for me to write my mother to come and get me.
I wrote my mother and three days later she came and got me.

After arriving back in Augusta,
my mother had the doctor come to the house and examine me.
He told mother that I was in bad shape,
that my blood pressure was real high--that was why I had the stroke.
My feet were swollen so bad that I couldn't wear shoes.
The doctor told my mother to give me epsom salts
and to keep me in bed with my feet elevated.
My mother was so worried about me,
she did everything she could to make me comfortable.
The night before the baby was born,
Lonnie caught a freight train and came to Augusta to see me.
I was sleeping in the room with my mother.
Around eleven o'clock that night I felt hungry.
My mother had cooked some turnip salad that day
and had bought some strawberries.
I asked Lonnie if he wanted something to eat.
He told me he would rather sleep.

I had just gotten to sleep, when my stomach started to hurt.
I felt like I had to go to the toilet, and it was at the end of the back yard.
When I got back to the house, mother was waiting at the back door.
She asked if I was sick and I said no.
But she couldn't be fooled.
I waited until I thought mother was asleep,
then sneaked outside to the toilet again.
When I got back to the house, mother was standing by the door again.
She wanted to take me to the hospital.
I told her I was all right, go back to bed and leave me alone.
But she went back to the room and called Lonnie.
She told him to get up, I was in labor.
He came and found me outside at the toilet for the third time.
He told me to get dressed for he was going to take me to the hospital.
He and mother took me to the hospital
where my baby daughter was born the next morning.
She was born feet first.
When mother came in to see me, I asked where Lonnie was,
and she said that Lonnie and my father had gone to Batesburg,
in the old Chevrolet.
That evening Lonnie and Pat came to see me, they had been drinking.
Pat said Lonnie had told her that I had died giving birth.
I was in the hospital for a week.
Mother came and took me and the baby home.
Lonnie decided he would try and get a job in Augusta
and stay with me and the baby.
We named her Lee.
My face straightened out after the baby was born.
When Lee was two weeks old, I went back to work at the mill.
There was a lot of back rent due on the house
and it took most everything I made to pay the rent.
Lonnie had a job with Mr. Parks helping to move furniture.
Sometimes he would make a dollar a day and sometimes a dollar and a half.

My brother Steve was still working at the drug store.
The whole family was crazy about the baby.
When Lee started teething,
my brother would buy her teething powders at the drug store,
and bring them home to her.
Lonnie and I stayed in the middle room.
When Lee was about six months old,
she took colitis of the bowels and the doctor said it was caused from nursing.
When I came home from the mill,
after working so hard all day, the milk was too hot.
He said if I was going to nurse my baby I would have to quit work,
because the milk would kill her.
Lonnie begged me to stop work and take care of the baby,
that we would make out somehow.
I only weighted ninety pounds and was really not able to work,
but I could not quit then.
I told Lonnie that I would keep on working until we found out
if my father was going to get the pension that was due him.
It was a pension for the blind.

Lonnie's parents moved back to Augusta.
His two sisters said they were going to rent a house
and wanted Lonnie and I to come and live with them.
They found a house on Ellis Street, but after they had been there for a while
the men friends began calling it the Hundred and One Ranch.
Ellen, Pat and a girlfriend of theirs lived there.
Allen, Lonnie's brother, was kind of stuck on the girlfriend.
The men that would come to the house would bring whiskey
and try to get Lonnie's parents drunk so they could take the girls off.
Lonnie and I slept in a little room on the side of the house.

One night some men came to the house to see the girls.
I was in my room putting the baby to bed.
One of the men came into my room, grabbed me, trying to hug and kiss me.
Lonnie ran into the room and grabbed the man by the collar and said,
"Take your hands off my wife."
They began fighting.
The others began running out the door,
hollering for their friend to hurry, the police were coming.
The man ran out the door, got into the car to get away from Lonnie,
but Lonnie threw a half pint of whiskey right through the windshield.

After that, when Lonnie had to work,
he would take me and the baby to my mother's
and leave us there until he came home at night.
This went on for several months.
Finally I got tired of going back and forth
and told Lonnie that we had a child and needed a home of our own.
Lonnie did not want to go in debt for furniture to start housekeeping.
I told him I was willing to cook in the fireplace and sleep on the floor
jus as long as we could have a little house by ourselves.

The government had a project called W.P.A.
I told Lonnie to see if he could get a job there.
He could probably make twice as much money moving furniture for Mr. Parks.
They also gave commodities like butter, grits and powdered milk.
He got a job with the W.P.A.
and my father started drawing his pension for the blind.
Lonnie was making twice the money that he had been making before
so there was no reason why we could not rent a house.
Lonnie still refused to go in debt for furniture.
A friend of mine told me that the Welfare department had used furniture
that they gave to poor people who needed it.
If I would go tell them how much I needed and wanted a home for my family,
they most likely would give me something to start housekeeping with.
I went down to the Welfare Department
and they gave me an old wash stand and a mattress, but no bedstead.
Lonnie bought a bedstead from his uncle for fifty cents.
Lonnie had an old trunk and my mother gave us an iron skillet.
Lonnie's mother gave us another iron skillet, plus a plate for each of us.
We rented a little two-room house on Ellis Street,
and moved what few things that had been given to us into our little house.
They day that we moved, Lonnie had gotten his pay check from the W.P.A.,
so we went and bought some silverware to get started,
a boiler and some wood to cook with.
I put some bricks in the fireplace
to set the boiler and skillets on to cook our meals.

We had been in our house alone for about three months
when my mother came to say that Leo, my half brother,
had TB and they were sending him to Alto, Georgia.
He stayed in Alto for about six months and then came home.
One of his lungs had collapsed and the other one was badly infected.
He said that he knew he was going to die
and he wanted to be with his family for as long as he could.
Leo's wife was expecting a baby and was not able to wait on him,
so he stayed with my mother.

While Leo was away a cousin of ours was watching over his family,
Leo stayed with mother until a month before he died,
then he went back to his own home.
Mother stayed with him and waited on him until he died.
I was there too.
I was standing in the room with his wife,
she was holding his head in her lap hugging and kissing him and crying.
Just before he died, the last words he said were, just let me rest.
I have often wondered if his wife's tears were for joy
because he had a good bit of insurance.
When he was lying in his casket,
his wife and first cousin were laughing and shooting dice right in front of him.
He had been dead only a few days
when my cousin and Leo's wife drove up in front of mother's house
in a new red convertible.
The evening they came to show the car off I was at mother's.
It made me so mad to see how she was acting.
I could not help but tell her she should have waited
at least until Leo was cold in his grave.
A few days later, we heard that she and my cousin had gotten married.
None of the family would have anything to do with her after that.
The next time I saw her was at my mother's funeral.

My brother had been dead just a few weeks when mother had to move.
She was no longer eligible to live in the mill house.
She moved into a duplex house.
There was a young married couple living next door.
As far back as I could remember, mother had nothing but trouble.
My sister, in the meantime, had grown up and was crazy about boys.
About two o'clock one morning, mother heard a noise on the back porch.
She got to see what was going on
and found my sister and the young man next door in their underwear.
When my sister saw mother, she began to cry rape.
My mother called the police and the young man was taken to jail,
but he got out on bond.
When the trail came due,
mother felt sorry for his young pregnant wife and dropped the charges.

To make things worse, my sister then began to run around
with a girl four years older who had a bad reputation.
Mother could not do anything with her.
Carol, my sister was only thirteen years old
and mother finally had to turn her over to the Juvenile Court.
They put her in a boarding home not too far from where mother lived.
Carol stayed at the home for about four months and then ran away and came home.
Mother was going to send her back, but Carol swore she would kill herself.
Mother brought Carol to my house where she met Lonnie's brother Mack.
Lonnie said if Carol and Mack could get married,
that the Juvenile Court would not make her go back to the boarding home.
So they got married, but that did not stop the trouble.

Carol was pretty and Mack became very jealous
and before long they were fighting.
They were living with my parents and Mack did not have a job.
He would go off in the morning with a lunch and pretend to look for work.
He would stay until late in the evening,
then come home saying he could not find any work.
Mack said he knew he could get a job in Washington, D.C.,
so he and Carol left and hitchhiked to Washington.
They stayed in Washington for about two weeks and then came back home.
About two weeks later, they left for Washington again.
This continued for about eight months.
Carol, who knew she could not make a go of the marriage, divorced Mack.
About six months after her divorce, she met Tom Neal and they got married.
He was a smart person and provided a good home for Carol,
but was unfaithful to her.
She did not find out for about two years.
Then one evening Carol asked Tom to take me up on the Furys Ferry Road
to see my sister-in-law Peggy, who had gotten married.
On the way up there, Tom cut off the road and turned into a wooded area.
When I asked where we were going, he told that this was a short cut.
But soon he stopped the car and started kissing me and trying to make love.
I twisted loose, opened the car and started to run back toward the highway.
He followed me and said he would not bother me anymore
and would take me to Peggy's.
I told him that he should be ashamed to try anything like that
with his wife's sister.
I also told him that I would not hurt my sister's feelings
by having an affair with her husband.
He just laughed.
